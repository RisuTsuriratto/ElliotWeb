    <main>
        <p>If you've tried the original experience and you found it too demanding, you might want to try <span class="green"><b>Elliot's Assiste Mode</b></span>.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>What is Assist Mode?</h3>
        <p>Assist Mode is a new play mode we've added for those players who find the original mode too demanding.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>How does it works?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>With Assist Mode, you can visualize Elliot's dash trajectory. We've added a previsualization in three colours:</li>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="yellow"><b>Yellow:</b></span> when you're going to crash into an enemy.</li>
                <li><span class="red"><b>Red:</b></span> when you're going to crash into something which will lead to your death.</li>
                <li><span class="blue"><b>Blue:</b></span> when you're going to crash into an enemy.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>In Assist Mode, you have longer to decide where to direct your dash. In other words, charging the dash takes longer than in Original Mode.</li>
            <li>In Assist Mode, notes collected last last longer - that's is, once caught, the note is kept. If you die, you must not go back for it in the next level attempt.</li>
            <li>In Assist Mode, levels are automatically unlocked as you collect notes.<br>
            Find yourself stuck on a level with no way out?<br>
            Dont' worry, take a loot at the level selection menu and see how many notes are needed to unlock the next level.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>How does it works?</h3>
        <p>You can activate Assist Mode starting a new game. But if you don't want to lose what you've already achieved, you can activate it at any moment from the Options Menu.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Other improvements:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Visually enchanced loading screen.</li>
            <li>We've added 10 suggestions and tips which appear on the loading screen when you choose Main Menu.</li>
            <li>We've fixed a few minor bugs.</li>
        </ul>
